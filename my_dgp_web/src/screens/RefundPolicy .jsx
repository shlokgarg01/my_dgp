                </ul>

                <h2>3. Non-Refundable Fees</h2>
                <p>Certain fees may not be refundable, including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Setup fees</li>

                <h2>4. Service-Specific Refund Terms</h2>
                <p>Different services may have specific refund terms or conditions. These terms will be outlined at the time of purchase or service agreement. In case of conflict between this general refund policy and service-specific terms, the service-specific terms will prevail.</p>

                <h2>5. Cancellations</h2>
                <p>You may cancel a service request at any time before the service is started by MYDGP TEAM. If you cancel after the service has been initiated, you may be eligible for a partial refund, depending on the stage of service completion. In such cases, MYDGP will assess the work completed and provide a refund for the unused portion of the service.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cancellation Fee:</strong> If a cancellation occurs after the service has started, a cancellation fee may apply, depending on the work that has already been performed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Cancellation:</strong> If a cancellation is requested after a significant portion of the service has been completed, the refund may be adjusted to account for the work already done.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Modifications to the Refund Policy</h2>
                <p>MYDGP reserves the right to modify or update this Refund Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page and will be effective immediately upon posting. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about any updates.</p>
                <p><strong>Effective Date of Changes:</strong> Any modifications or updates to the refund policy will be reflected in this document with the new effective date. By continuing to use our services after such modifications, you agree to the updated terms.</p>

                <h2>7. Exemptions and Special Circumstances</h2>
                <p>Refunds may be provided in special circumstances, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Service Delivery Failures:</strong> If technical issues or server problems prevent us from delivering the service on time.</li>

                    <li><strong>Service Quality Issues:</strong> If the service does not meet the agreed-upon standards or specifications. Refunds may be issued after our team assesses the situation and provides solutions for correction.</li>

                <p>However, these are assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                <h2>8. Force Majeure</h2>
                <p>MYDGP will not be held responsible for delays or failure to perform services due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, war, terrorism, pandemic, or any other circumstances that may prevent the completion of the service as agreed.</p>

                <p><strong>Materials Not Provided:</strong> Failure to submit required materials for service completion could result in delays, and may limit the refund to a partial amount, depending on the work that has already been done.</p>

                <h2>12. Refund for Prepaid Services</h2>
                <p>If you have paid for a service in advance and wish to cancel, you may receive a refund based on the stage of completion of the service at the time of cancellation. The refund amount will be calculated based on the work already completed.</p>
                <p><strong>Refund Adjustment:</strong> In cases where work has already been completed, the refund will be prorated according to the services already rendered.</p>

                <h2>13. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>If any issues arise regarding your refund request, we encourage you to contact MYDGP directly so that we can resolve the matter. If a resolution cannot be reached, you may consider alternative dispute resolution options as per applicable laws.</p>
